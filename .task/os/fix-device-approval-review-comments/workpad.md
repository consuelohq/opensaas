## review-comment fix summary

- Verified both PR #1013 review findings were valid.
- Fixed CR-001 by making `/login/device/approve` ignore raw `x-consuelo-account-*` headers and require a signed `x-consuelo-account-assertion` verified with `OS_DEVICE_AUTH_ASSERTION_SECRET`.
- Added regression coverage that forged allowed account headers cannot approve and the grant remains pending.
- Fixed CR-002 by retaining install-session device key material in the client and adding a signed device-key proof to `/login/oauth/access_token` polling.
- Updated the authority to verify proof payload/signature against the stored device public key before returning bootstrap material.
- Added regression coverage that an approved device code cannot be redeemed without matching proof and that valid proof succeeds.

## validation evidence

- Focused authority/client/onboarding tests: `trc_036bde2732ec` — 5 passed, 5 skipped.
- Opt-in hardening contract: `trc_507a6efb37e1` — 5 passed.
- Default hardening contract run: `trc_afa913dc3b2a` — skipped by default, exit 0.
- OS syntax/typecheck: `trc_54f3e495cf16` — passed.
- Review gate: `trc_9c3165583718` — 0 blocking issues.
- Verify gate: `trc_3e62e8c26ccb` — publish-valid.
