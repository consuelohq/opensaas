# DEV-1500 replace sandbox_exec with workspace.call

branch: `task/workspace-agents/dev-1500-replace-sandbox-exec-with-workspace-call`
stream: `stream/workspace-agents`
linear: DEV-1500
task pr: https://github.com/consuelohq/opensaas/pull/336
started: 2026-05-06

## acceptance criteria

- [ ] Replace the normal MCP operation surface from `sandbox_exec` to `workspace.call`.
- [ ] Keep `get_steering` simple: always return full current steering; do not cache or reject repeated calls.
- [ ] Add task-session-backed task context for task-scoped calls.
- [ ] Make `batch` first-class under `workspace.call` with task context propagation.
- [ ] Update steering, scripts docs, generated tool docs/types, schemas, manifest, and facade tests.
- [ ] Validate the end-to-end task lifecycle through the new call surface.

## plan

1. Inspect current MCP server, sandbox wrapper, facade executor, branch resolver, batch runner, schemas, manifest, and docs.
2. Replace the MCP boundary so typed calls dispatch through the existing facade instead of shell-wrapped commands.
3. Add durable task session creation/resolution and tmux-backed metadata.
4. Propagate `taskSession` into batch children and lifecycle commands.
5. Update documentation/generated surfaces and tests.
6. Run focused syntax checks, facade tests, review, verify, push, and promote to the stream review PR.

## key decisions

- `packages/workspace/server.py` is the current MCP registration point. It exposed `get_steering` and `sandbox_exec`.
- The existing typed facade path is `packages/workspace/scripts/lib/facade/executor.ts`, called by `packages/workspace/scripts/tool-runner.ts`.
- The first patch changes the server boundary only: it exposes `call`, removes the server import/use of `tools.sandbox`, routes through `bun scripts/workspace.ts`, and keeps `get_steering` returning full steering on every call.
- Added `packages/workspace/scripts/lib/task-session.js` as the tmux/session owner. It creates deterministic `taskSession` handles, sanitized tmux session names, tmux sessions rooted at the task worktree, and `.task/session.json`.
- Wired `task-start.js` to create tmux-backed task sessions and include `taskSession`/`tmuxSession` in `.task/current.json`, task history, and task-start output.
- `task-exec.js` now passes both `TASK_BRANCH` and `TASK_WORKTREE` into child commands.
- `server.py` now rejects task-scoped `workspace.call` calls without `taskSession`, while allowing explicit `input.branch` as the compatibility escape hatch.

## notes for ko

- This is partial implementation, not ready for review.
- Code read confirmed tmux belongs at `task-start.js`: it already owns branch/worktree/PR/current metadata/workpad creation.
- The current live MCP server still exposes `sandbox_exec` until the patched server is deployed/restarted.
- Direct import smoke for `server.py` failed in this shell because `uvicorn` is missing from the local Python environment. Syntax compilation passed.

## improvements noticed

- The active workspace command surface is fragile for large inline Python/task.exec commands. `mac.exec` with base64 positional payload was the safest workaround for this edit.
- The decision-engine query was blocked by the tool safety filter when it included the issue wording; narrower exploration then hit intermittent MCP network failures.

## errors or blockers

- `workspace explore` was blocked by safety checks for DEV-1500 wording.
- One narrowed `workspace explore` call and one branch-scoped batch read failed with `mcp_network_error`.
- `workspace task.exec` with nested shell/Python payloads produced `workspace commands accept at most one JSON input argument`.
- Direct Python import smoke failed with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'uvicorn'`.

## validation

- `python3 -m py_compile packages/workspace/server.py` passed.
- `git diff -- packages/workspace/server.py` was inspected.
- `node --check packages/workspace/scripts/lib/task-session.js` passed.
- `node --check packages/workspace/scripts/task-start.js` passed.
- `node --check packages/workspace/scripts/task-exec.js` passed.
- Smoke-created `.task/session.json` for the current task with `taskSession=tsk_12cf9dfeaa9f`; tmux session creation succeeded.
- Direct `server.py` behavior smoke is still blocked by missing local Python packages (`starlette` after `uvicorn` was mocked).

## review fix pass — 2026-05-06

Confirmed and fixed required review findings:

- Removed process-global `ALREADY_LOADED` steering behavior; after follow-up review, `get_steering` now reads and returns full current steering on every call instead of caching.
- Added standard server-side envelopes for workspace.call boundary failures.
- Derived session-required MCP enforcement from `tool-manifest.json` via `sessionRequired` instead of a hardcoded server list.
- Added configurable worktree root support using `WORKSPACE_WORKTREE_ROOT`, `OPENSAAS_WORKTREE_ROOT`, then `os.tmpdir()/opensaas-worktrees` / `tempfile.gettempdir()/opensaas-worktrees`.
- Moved tmux availability validation earlier in `task.start`; tmux session creation now happens before bootstrap commit and PR creation after the worktree exists.
- Changed `task.exec` to execute through the task's tmux session and fail when tmux session metadata is missing.
- Rejected `taskSession` + explicit `branch` together to avoid silent branch override.
- Replaced blank workpad acceptance criteria placeholder with explicit guidance.
- Made task session parse errors visible on stderr.
- Added runtime guards and a successful-read cache for task session metadata in the TS facade.
- Hardened server subprocess execution with `shell=False`, `check=False`, FileNotFoundError handling, and no internal `input` shadowing.
- Added MCP boundary unit tests for steering cache, standard envelopes, manifest-derived session enforcement, batch taskSession propagation, branch conflict, and missing executable handling.
- Isolated taskSession facade tests with temp dirs/env overrides and cleanup.

Validation after review fix pass:

- `python3 -m py_compile packages/workspace/server.py`
- `python3 -m unittest packages/workspace/tests/server_call_test.py`
- `bun --check` for edited TS files and `generate-docs.ts`
- `node --check` for edited JS files
- `bun test packages/workspace/tests/facade/facade.test.ts` → 492 pass
- `bun run review` → pass
- `bun run verify` → pass

## steering cache removal — 2026-05-06

- Ko clarified that caching does not solve the per-chat duplicate-call problem and creates stale steering/tool-manifest risk.
- Removed `_STEERING_CACHE`; `get_steering` now calls `_read_steering` every time and always returns full current steering.
- Updated `server_call_test.py` to prove repeated calls re-read steering.

Validation:

- `python3 -m py_compile packages/workspace/server.py`
- `python3 -m unittest packages/workspace/tests/server_call_test.py`

## review fix pass — tmux/docs/session cache — 2026-05-06

Confirmed and fixed Ko's required findings:

- Fixed `assertTmuxAvailable()` recursion in `packages/workspace/scripts/lib/task-session.js`; it now calls `isTmuxAvailable()` and throws a clear tmux-required error.
- Removed task session metadata caching from both `server.py` and `executor.ts`; session metadata is read from `.task/session.json` discovery paths on each call.
- Removed the extra `task-start.js` async try/catch wrappers that rethrew new `Error` instances and lost stack context; kept the existing top-level `main().catch` handler.
- Updated `STEERING.md` and `decision.md` so normal workflow examples use `workspace.call({ tool, input, taskSession, timeout })` instead of `sandbox_exec` or nested shell/JSON workspace command strings.

Validation:

- `python3 -m py_compile packages/workspace/server.py`
- `bun --check packages/workspace/scripts/lib/facade/executor.ts`
- `node --check packages/workspace/scripts/lib/task-session.js`
- `node --check packages/workspace/scripts/task-start.js`
- `python3 -m unittest packages/workspace/tests/server_call_test.py -v`
- `bun test packages/workspace/tests/facade/facade.test.ts` → 492 pass
- `assertTmuxAvailable()` smoke passed with local tmux
- `rg` confirmed no `sandbox_exec`, `workspace.sandbox_exec`, `TASK_SESSION_CACHE`, `taskSessionMetadataCache`, or nested `workspace <tool> '{...}'` examples remain in the targeted docs/code.

Review note:

- `bun run review -- --base task/workspace-agents/dev-1500-replace-sandbox-exec-with-workspace-call --json --quiet --no-tests` reports one pre-existing `ERROR_HANDLING` heuristic finding for `task-start.js:266`. This is expected because Ko explicitly requested removing the extra try/catch and relying on the existing top-level `main().catch` handler.
