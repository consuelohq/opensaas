opensaas is an open-source sales infrastructure SDK. monorepo with @consuelo/* packages:
- dialer (twilio, local presence, caller ID locking, parallel dialing)
- coaching (AI via groq/openai, real-time + post-call, zod structured outputs)
- analytics (call metrics, transcription processing)
- contacts (contact management, CSV import, phone normalization, queue system)
- api (framework-agnostic REST routes with auth + rate limiting)
- cli (consuelo CLI tool)
- sdk (unified entry point)
- metering (usage tracking, billing)
- workspace (org management)
- logger (structured logging)

also includes a twenty CRM fork (frontend) on the twenty-fork branch with an embedded dialer sidebar.

tech: typescript strict, turbo, postgres, pgvector, redis, twilio, stripe, groq/openai, recoil (twenty frontend).

mandatory coding standards (enforced by pre-push hooks):
- no console.* — use structured logger (@consuelo/logger)
- sentry tracking on all HTTP errors and caught exceptions
- phone comparisons must use normalizePhone() from @consuelo/contacts
- SQL queries must be parameterized ($1, $2) — no template literals in .query()
- async/await must have try/catch within 30 lines
- no explicit any without // HACK: comment
- no hardcoded secrets
- TODO/FIXME must reference a ticket (DEV-123)
- no wildcard imports (except builtins and sentry)
- literal routes before param routes in same prefix group
- catch (err) must be typed as : unknown
- peerDependencies must use lazy await import(), never top-level import
- route handlers return real data or explicit 501 — no hardcoded fakes without // STUB:

conventions: one PR per feature, commit format type(scope): description, shared service instances (not per-request).
